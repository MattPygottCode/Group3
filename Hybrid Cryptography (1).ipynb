    "We spent most of the first two weeks of the project working out how to code collaboratively. Charles disuaded us from trying to use Notable or emailing each other sections of code like some Frankenstein's monster. This would be particularly problematic as the later questions depended heavily on the first question.\n",
    "\n",
    "So, we attempted to use GitHub.\n",
    "\n",
    "Matt, who is most experience with coding, having done Computer Science A Level, set up a GitHub repository for us. We then tried to set up Visual Studio Code, which we new could be integrated with GitHub to make it easier to pull and push changes.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, this created it's own issues, as the whole team had to install and get used to VSCode, which is powerful but confusing to start with. Sam, one of the helpers in one of the tutorials was very helpful.\n",
    "\n",
    "But, the technical difficulties kept coming.\n",
    "\n",
    "From installing Python natively to cloning directly onto our computers, we overcame waves upon waves of novel challenges. In the end, we decided not to use branches as this added another layer of complication. Some members of the team also dragged and dropped their changes manually to and from GitHub as they could not get this feature within VSCode to work.\n",
    "\n",
    "While there may have been a more effective method for our level of expertise (or lack of), once we worked out how to use GitHub, it did have the benefit of backing up everything we commit so that we could go back if anything was accidentally overwritten or deleted. It was also a very good was to learn how to use GitHub, in case any of us do more formal collaborative coding in future.\n",

    "It is clear to see with this algorith that the function smallest factor is not an efficient way of factorising large integers. As directed by the question, we then wrote a function that implements the Pollard rho method.\n",
    "\n",
    "For our first version of the pollard rho function, we tried to recreate the example given in the pollard_rho.pdf. It was very useful to have this example to work with so we could compare the numbers we achieved versus those we'd expect at each iteration. It tool  a while to work out where within the algorithm to apply the function to m1 and m2 to get m1s and m2s, but the final result is quite simple.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here's the example we started with: Consider the integer N = 78667. We make use of the pseudo-random sequence defined by m0 = 3, mi+1 = m2i −1 (mod N) to obtain a factorisation of N. The sequence is (3,8,63,3968,11623,22889,62767,52928,41313,4736,9600,...) so our algorithm computes, gcd(m2 −m1,N) = gcd(63 −8,78667) = 1, and continuing, that gcd(m2s −m1s,N) = 1 for s = 2,3,4. However, gcd(m10 −m5,N) = gcd(9600 −22889,78667) = 97 and so, as 78667/97 = 811 we have found the factorisation 78667 = 97 ·811."
