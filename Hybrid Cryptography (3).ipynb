It was very useful to have this example to work with so we could compare the numbers we achieved versus those we'd expect at each iteration. It tool  a while to work out where within the algorithm to apply the function to m1 and m2 to get m1s and m2s, but the final result is quite simple.\n",

The sequence is (3,8,63,3968,11623,22889,62767,52928,41313,4736,9600,...) so our algorithm computes, gcd(m2 −m1,N) = gcd(63 −8,78667) = 1, and continuing, that gcd(m2s −m1s,N) = 1 for s = 2,3,4. However, gcd(m10 −m5,N) = gcd(9600 −22889,78667) = 97 and so, as 78667/97 = 811 we have found the factorisation 78667 = 97 ·811.\n",
