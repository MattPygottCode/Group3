    "\n",
    "This function works in a few simple steps. \n",
    "1. We make copies of the input text and key and clean them both. Cleaning the key is really helpful here as it means the function can consistently decrypt texts even if someone drops a case in one letter of the key. Note we capitalise the key in the clean_text function by setting preserve_case=False.\n",
    "2. We iterate through each character in the input text. For each character we cipher it using the part of the key in the corresponding place. Each character in the key is equivalent to an integer that we can encrypt with (with A being the null shift 0). If the message is longer than the key then we start from the beginning of the key again hence the modulus in the line defining ith_key.\n",
    "3. Using the ith_key we encrypt each character in input_text and concatenate it onto output_text\n",
    "4. We return output_text\n",

    "### First attempt at writing the Pollard Rho function (V2)\n",
    "\n",
    "For our first version of the pollard rho function, we tried to recreate the example given in the pollard_rho.pdf. It was very useful to have this example to work with so we could compare the numbers we achieved versus those we'd expect at each iteration. It tool  a while to work out where within the algorithm to apply the function to m1 and m2 to get m1s and m2s, but the final result is quite simple.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here's the example we started with: Consider the integer N = 78667. We make use of the pseudo-random sequence defined by m0 = 3, mi+1 = m2i −1 (mod N) to obtain a factorisation of N. The sequence is (3,8,63,3968,11623,22889,62767,52928,41313,4736,9600,...) so our algorithm computes, gcd(m2 −m1,N) = gcd(63 −8,78667) = 1, and continuing, that gcd(m2s −m1s,N) = 1 for s = 2,3,4. However, gcd(m10 −m5,N) = gcd(9600 −22889,78667) = 97 and so, as 78667/97 = 811 we have found the factorisation 78667 = 97 ·811.\n",
