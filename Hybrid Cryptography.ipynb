We will then improve the security of your system by adding an extra layer of random encoding. Lastly, we will complete one of the extensions, from either section 5 (breaking the Vigenère cipher), section 6 (cracking the RSA protocol), or section 7 (implementing RSA+AES and DH+AES)."

    "So, we attempted to use GitHub.\n",

    "Matt, who is most experience with coding, having done Computer Science A Level, set up a GitHub repository for us. We then tried to set up Visual Studio Code, which we new could be integrated with GitHub to make it easier to pull and push changes.\n",

    "However, this created it's own issues, as the whole team had to install and get used to VSCode, which is powerful but confusing to start with. Sam, one of the helpers in one of the tutorials was very helpful.\n",
    "\n",
    "But, the technical difficulties kept coming.\n",
    "\n",
    "From installing Python natively to cloning directly onto our computers, we overcame waves upon waves of novel challenges. In the end, we decided not to use branches as this added another layer of complication. Some members of the team also dragged and dropped their changes manually to and from GitHub as they could not get this feature within VSCode to work.\n",
    "\n",
    "While there may have been a more effective method for our level of expertise (or lack of), once we worked out how to use GitHub, it did have the benefit of backing up everything we committ so that we could go back if anything was accidentally overwritten or deleted. It was also a very good was to learn how to use GitHub, in case any of us do more formal collaborative coding in future.\n",
