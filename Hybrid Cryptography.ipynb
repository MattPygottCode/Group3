    "Example. Consider the integer N = 78667. We make use of the pseudo-random sequence defined by m0 = 3, mi+1 = m2i −1 (mod N) to obtain a factorisation of N. The sequence is (3,8,63,3968,11623,22889,62767,52928,41313,4736,9600,...) so our algorithm computes, gcd(m2 −m1,N) = gcd(63 −8,78667) = 1, and continuing, that gcd(m2s −m1s,N) = 1 for s = 2,3,4. However, gcd(m10 −m5,N) = gcd(9600 −22889,78667) = 97 and so, as 78667/97 = 811 we have found the factorisation 78667 = 97 ·811.\n",
