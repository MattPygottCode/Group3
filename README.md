# Group3

This is our repository for our Hybrid Cryptography group project!

Feel free to add any thoughts or links to useful documents / information etc.

**Collaborating coding tools:**

We are planning to all use Github and Visual Studio Code to edit and share our code.

Please ask for help if you are struggling with these tools.

**Task management tools:**

We are planning to use excel spreadsheet to list tasks, deadlines and who completed them.

Please update the spreadheet when you've completed a tast and update the team on WhatsApp also.

Excel link for tasks: https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1oS0quzfqXyGIA9sFu5PjXXK4FV-di4D9JVFiSI4uRsA/edit?usp=sharing

**Variable naming:**

Variable names should contain only lowercase letters unless necessary eg matrix M can have a capital.

Words should be separated by an underscore e.g. user_id

**Organising functions:**

Functions should be contained in a separate file to the main notebook

**Good commenting practices:**

Remember to write comments thoughout your code and on each function

Write your comments in lowercase and save uppercase for markdown plain text
